In this setting, piston configurations are analyzed in which the piston is modeled by a potential. For these configurations, analytic results for the Casimir energy and force are obtained by employing the zeta function regularization method. Also, explicit numerical results for the Casimir force are provided for pistons modeled by a class of compactly supported potentials that are realizable as delta-sequences. These results are then generalized to higher dimensional pistons by considering additional Kaluza–Klein dimensions.}

Even after volume energy subtractions are performed, the results are cutoff dependent. It is argued that the cutoff-dependent term is spurious, perhaps being a modification to the phenomenological description of the medium, and so should be cancelled by a contact term. If so, we are left with an attractive Casimir stress, which could play the role of the Poincaré stress in classical electron theory. The limit ϵ → ∞, a perfectly conducting ball, is more convergent and gives a parameter-free value for the fine-structure constant, α ⋍ 14π."

A supersymmetric gauge theory of area-preserving transformations provides a convenient framework for this study. The supermembrane can be viewed as a limiting case of a class of models in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Its mass does not depend on the zero modes and vanishes only if the wave function is a singlet under supersymmetry transformations of the nonzero modes. We exhibit the complexity of the supermembrane ground state and examine various truncations of these models. None of these truncations has massless states."
